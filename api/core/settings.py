The settings module for the Python Discord API.

The settings will be automatically loaded from environment
variables with the same name as the class attributes. In
addition, a `.env`-file will automatically be parsed in a
development environment.

To use settings in other parts of the application, you can
import the name `settings` from `api.core` directly.
